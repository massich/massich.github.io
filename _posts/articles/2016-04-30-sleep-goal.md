Here’s the thing: **I’m messed up, no kiding**.
There’s nothing specially wrong, but the whole thing just don’t add up.
A little break up, a job that despite my love for research seems to trap me with guilt when I don’t meet my own unrealistic standards or deadlines, the same guilt for not following my own training programs for my next **IronMan** which I fear to show up untrained like the last **IM**, not taking care of my diet which felt off the wagon early this ear, a home that for whatever reason don’t please me...

It does not really matter which reason from the endless list of stupid minutia bothering me made me not get out of bed today.
But reality is that today has been lost streaming TV on my laptop and I even skipped all the meals.
At least I spent my useless day watching coding conferences in youtube, but this is only because I am already out of all the creepy TV shows I regularly watch.

So I decided to take action with something that have been bugging me for **very long** time.
My sleep

## SMART definition of the goal

- **Specific:** I’m focusing on **sleep** until the **IM** race.
- **Measurable:** I will enter my bed at 9:30pm with no connection or whatsoever until 5:30am. The sleep would be recorded with sleeping with android.
- **Attainable:** If I *disconnect* and do my sleeping meditation, I would sleep right away.
- **Relevant:** Sleep is the key for regularity, and will power. For **ADD**ers, like me, sleep regularity is a must.
- **Time-bound:** I won’t delude myself into thinking I can do this forever without any proof. I’m shooting for 70 perfect days.

The *timeframe* for this goal is **1/05/16** to **7/07/16** when I’ll do the **tirathlon of Vitoria**
If I’m successful, I would get to the **IM** at least well rested :)

## Letting the Goal Structure My Life

I’m an *evening* owl. My mental strength and concentration peak is from around 8:30pm to 1:00am; Give or take.
I’m tired before this period and I’m dead afterwards.
In between, I’m on fire.
This is great for dinner conversations with friends because I’m on my best until I crash right after the first drink.
It also comes in handy for the last push in late night submissions.
However, this is horrible for several reasons:
Having the peak during the evening means that your body is tired and your wheal of will is empty.
Your prioritization gets lousy and you end up putting your best in something useless, like getting hooked in whatever is happening on TV or Internet.

According to Tim Ferris, the best physical workout abortion is around 4:00pm;
and according to [Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain](http://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=sl1&tag=colinfgee-20&linkId=51c4561d09f0d48ec44b2656b6f0fede), the brain is primed to pay attention at peak levels right after exercising.
I can tell that if I teach at the last shift (15:30-17:30) I could fall asleep when right away once I get home around 7pm.
But when I train after class I get home all jacked.

So, with all that in mind, I **really** have to:

- unplug before 8:00-8:30pm time window.
- establish a falling sleep routine (brushing teeth way before bed time, otherwise the toothpaste flavor keeps me awake)
- capitalize my work on my lower concentration peak (8:00am to 11:00am, if I got up at least couple of hours earlier).
- do the regular and shorter trainings early morning to boost and consolidate the morning peak.
- place hard and long trainings at the afternoon but not after 5:00pm.

And then, get my butt to sleep before 9:30pm and get **immediately** out of bed at 5:30am.


## Rules and Consequences


I’m removing barriers to success by setting as goal sleep and wake up times, not how much I sleep.
My goal is to change my relation with my bed.
I’ll be on my bed only during 9:30pm to 5:30am, and with the only purpose of sleeping.
At least during this 70 days period any other activity should be carried out somewhere else and out of this time window.

I would also increase my chances of success by **removing (or placing) barriers** and making myself **accountable**.
This includes:

- setting 3 alarms for bed time 8:30pm, 9:10pm and 9:30pm.
- having my sleep mediation off-line.
- setting up my alarm deactivation by scanning a QR that I’ve placed on the wall with all my racing bibs.
- forcing myself to make my bed and sent a picture of it somewhere to check its time-stamp.
- this post already makes me publicly accountable, but I’ll let **Elia** to make me do something embarrassing, take pictures and post them here if I fail even once. Additionally, instead of jumping with her from a plane this summer I’ll give the cost of a tandem jump in solo jumps for her.
